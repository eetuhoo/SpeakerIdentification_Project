# pytorch-speaker-identification
This repository contains the code for my Bachelor's thesis titled as "Comparison of different features for neural network-based models in speaker identification".

The code is developed using PyTorch, and it provides an implementation for speaker identification. The code was used for the purpose of comparing the performance of log-mel features and raw audio, and so it contains an input pipeline which extracts and prepares these features from digital audio.
